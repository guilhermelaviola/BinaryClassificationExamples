# Spam Detection
Spam detection is one of the most common binary classification problems in the data science community. Every newbie in data science tries this problem to figure out how to solve the binary classification problem. Here, you will be given a dataset of spam and not spam emails or messages, and your task here is to train a machine learning model to classify whether a message or email falls into the category of spam or ham (not spam).

# Fake News Detection
The detection of fake news is an advanced binary classification problem. It is also very popular among the data science community. Here, you will be given a dataset containing news headlines with labels as fake and real news, and your task here is to train a machine learning model to predict if the news is fake or real based on the news headlines. You can find many fake news detection datasets on the internet that use other data sources rather than the news headlines, but the way to solve this problem will remain the same.
